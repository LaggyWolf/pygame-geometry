# The pygame.Geometry Python Prototype Project
Hello! this project is a Python prototype for a pygame.geometry module. You will be able to use new Shape types like Circle, Line and Polygon to enchance, simplify and optimize your game code!

The project has three sections:

- **Implementation**

    Includes all the currently implemented shapes source(.py) files, including the shape.py file.
- **Tests**
    
   Includes visual and functional tests to ensure that the current implementations work as intended.
   
- **Benchmarks**

   Includes runtime benchmarks for each shape. Benchmarks typically test basic shape functionalities, but can also test interactions between different functionalities.

## The Shapes
This project adds new shapes along with new shape functionality. Each shape will have many methods for updating as well as methods for collision detection and shape conversion (shape->enclosing rect).
**Implements**
- Line (line segment)
- Circle
- Polygon

## Non Shape functionalities
This project will also focus on adding widely used functionalities in game engines such as Rays and RayCasting.

**Implements**
- Ray / RayCasting
